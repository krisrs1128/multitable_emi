\usage{
merge_svd_cov_opts(opts = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{opts}{A partially specified list of options to use when performing the
SVD imputation. The currently supported options are
 $batch_samples: The proportion of samples to use when evaluating gradients
  for each user's / track's latent factors. Defaults to 1, so it is usual
  gradient rather than stochastic gradient descent.
 $batch_factors: The proportion of factors to update during each iteration.
  Defaults to 1, so it is usual  gradient rather than stochastic gradient
  descent.
 $gamma_pq: The learning rate for the users and tracks factors.
 $gamma_beta: The learning rate for the regression covariates.
 $k_factors: How many latent factors should we use for the users and tracks?
 $lambdas: Regularization parameters for user factors, track factors, and
  covariates regression coefficients, respectively.
 $n_iter: Number of iterations to run the (stochastic) gradient descent)}
