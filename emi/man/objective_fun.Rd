\arguments{
\item{X}{The ratings matrix. Unobserved entries must be marked NA. Users
must be along rows, and tracks must be along columns.}

\item{Z}{The covariates associated with each pair. This must be shaped as an
array with users along rows, tracks along columns, and features along
slices.}

\item{P}{The learned user latent factors.}

\item{Q}{The learned track latent factors.}

\item{beta}{The learned regression coefficients.}

\item{lambda}{The regularization parameters for P, Q, and beta, respectively.}

The value of the objective function given the current parameter
values.

The value of the objective function given the current parameter

\description{
This is the sum of squared error at observed entries,
between the ratings matrix and its approximation by latent factors and
covariates.
